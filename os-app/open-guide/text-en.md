Emoji Log helps you measure your progress by making it simple to track when meaningful steps are taken.

It is inspired by a philosophy of taking the smallest step possible, also known as [Kaizen](https://rosano.hmm.garden/01em4bgta0g35sd74nt8p6wkkb).

# Shortcuts

<div class="OLSKDecorNotice">

*AccessKey* refers to a one or more shortcut keys followed by a single character. Usually it's `Alt` on Windows or `Control+Alt` on macOS, but it changes [based on your browser and operating system](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_global_accesskey.asp#table2).

*Launcher* refers to the app's command runner: press `Alt+Space`, type the command, then press `Enter` to run.

# What are remoteStorage and Fission?

[remoteStorage](https://remotestorage.io) and [Fission](https://fission.codes) are open protocols for synchronizing data between multiple devices. Both take the level of control and flexibility of something like email and bring it to your personal data. You could think of it as a USB key for your documents that you can plug into websites to work on your stuff.

You can get a remoteStorage account for free from [5apps](https://5apps.com/storage/) or [host your own](https://remotestorage.io/servers).

You can get a Fission account for free from [Fission Auth](https://auth.fission.codes) or [setup your own server](https://github.com/fission/fission).
